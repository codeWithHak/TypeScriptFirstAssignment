// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let myFriends:string[] = ["Hamza","Khizar","Abdullah","Huzaifa","Farrukh"]



for (let friend of myFriends){
    console.log(`Hello ${friend} how are you`);
